Discussion 5 Instructions:
Write a program that prompts a user for a series of integers until they are done 
  (you decide what done looks like for your program!) and then 
prints the sum, 
      the average, and 
      the minimum and 
          maximum integers entered.

Feel free to add any additional statistics you are interested in calculating. 
You design the UX - be creative!
